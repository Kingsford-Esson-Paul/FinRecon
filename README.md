npm install lucide-react --force

Installs the lucide-react package, which provides a collection of icons for React applications.
The --force flag forces npm to resolve dependency conflicts, but it's usually better to try npm install lucide-react first without --force.
npm run build

Builds the project for production by optimizing the assets and generating the necessary output files.
npm run dev

Starts the development server, allowing you to see changes in real time.
